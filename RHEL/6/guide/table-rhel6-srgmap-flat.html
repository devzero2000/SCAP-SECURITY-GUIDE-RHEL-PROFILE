<td>The operating system must  provide automated support for account management functions.</td>

Examples include, but are not limited to using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as, multiple servers.

Enterprise environments make user account management challenging and complex. A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.

<td>Users are often the first line of defense within an application.  Active users take notice of system and data conditions and are usually the first to notify systems administrators when they notice a system or application related anomaly pertaining to their own account. Inactive user accounts pose a risk to systems and applications. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.  

There is a risk that inactive accounts can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to an application. The operating system must track periods of user inactivity and disable the accounts after an organization-defined period of inactivity.

<td>The operating system must prevent access to organization-defined security-relevant information except during secure, non-operable system states.</td>
<td>Security-relevant information is any information within the information system potentially impacting the operation of security functions in a manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data. Organizations may define specific security relevant information requiring protection.

Filtering rules for routers and firewalls, cryptographic key management information, key configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists are examples of security-relevant information. 

Secure, non-operable system states are states in which the information system is not performing mission/business-related processing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shutdown). 

Access to these types of data is to be prevented unless the system is in a maintenance mode or has otherwise been brought off-line. The goal is to minimize the potential that a security configuration or data may be dynamically and perhaps surreptitiously overwritten or changed (without going through a formal system change process documenting the changes).

<td>The operating system must enforce information flow control using explicit security attributes on information, source, and destination objects as a basis for flow control decisions.</td>
<td>Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to the information. 

Examples of flow control restrictions include: keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; and blocking outside traffic claiming to be from within the organization and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.

Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes on all information (data content and data structure), source and destination objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by the information flow policy. Information flow enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.

Additionally, the person or entity accountable for monitoring the activity must be separate as well. 

Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals perform operating system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, network security); (iii) security personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions; and (iv) different administrator accounts for different roles.

<td>configure_auditd_data_retention</td>
<td>Configure auditd Data Retention</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
The audit system writes data to <code>/var/log/audit/audit.log</code>. By default,
<code>auditd</code> rotates 5 logs by size (6MB), retaining a maximum of 30MB of
data in total, and refuses to write entries when the disk is too
full. This minimizes the risk of audit data filling its partition
and impacting other services. This also minimizes the risk of the audit
daemon temporarily disabling the system if it cannot write audit log (which
it can be configured to do).

For a busy
system or a system which is thoroughly auditing system activity, the default settings
for data retention may be
 insufficient. The log file size needed will depend heavily on what types
of events are being audited. First configure auditing to log all the events of
interest. Then monitor the log size manually for awhile to determine what file
size will allow you to keep the required data for the correct time period.
<br><br>
Using a dedicated partition for <code>/var/log/audit</code> prevents the
<code>auditd</code> logs from disrupting system functionality if they fill, and,
more importantly, prevents other activity in <code>/var</code> from filling the
partition and stopping the audit trail. (The audit logs are size-limited and
therefore unlikely to grow without bound unless configured to do so.) Some
machines may have requirements that no actions occur which cannot be audited.
If this is the case, then <code>auditd</code> can be configured to halt the machine
if it runs out of space. <b>Note:</b> Since older logs are rotated,
configuring <code>auditd</code> this way does not prevent older logs from being
rotated away before they can be viewed.

<i>If your system is configured to halt when logging cannot be performed, make
sure this can never happen under normal circumstances! Ensure that
<code>/var/log/audit</code> is on its own partition, and that this partition is
larger than the maximum amount of data <code>auditd</code> will retain
normally.</i>

An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy requirements regarding what must be audited on the system and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. 

Audit reduction and reporting tools do not alter original audit records.

<td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br>

<td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br>

<td>The operating system must provide additional protection for mobile devices accessed via login by purging information from the device after organization-defined number of consecutive, unsuccessful login attempts to the mobile device.
</td>
<td>Mobile devices present additional risks related to attempted unauthorized access. If they are lost, stolen or misplaced, attempts can be made to unlock the device by guessing the PIN. In order to address this risk, mobile devices shall provide additional protection enabling the device to automatically wipe itself clean and purge itself of any and all data. 

This requirement applies only to mobile devices for which a login occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants and smart phones) and not to mobile devices accessed without a login such as removable media. In certain situations, this requirement may not apply to mobile devices if the information on the device is encrypted with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms, making purging unnecessary. The login is to the mobile device, not to any one account on the device. 

Therefore, a successful login to any account on the mobile device resets the unsuccessful login count to zero.

<td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br>

<td>The operating system must display security attributes in human-readable form on each object output from the system to system output devices to identify an organization-identified set of special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions using organization-identified human readable, standard naming conventions.</td>
<td>Security attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects, objects) with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files, registry keys) within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy. 

The term security label is often used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure for that object (e.g., user access privileges, nationality, affiliation as contractor). A security label is defined as the means used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure for the object.

Security attributes need to be displayed in human readable form in order to determine how the data should be disseminated, handled, and what distribution instructions apply to the data. When applications generate or output data, the associated security attributes need to be displayed.</td>
