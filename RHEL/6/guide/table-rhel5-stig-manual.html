<td>Changing the root home directory to something other than / and assigning it a 0700 protection makes it more difficult for intruders to manipulate the system by reading the files root places in its default
      directory. It also gives root the same discretionary access control for root's home directory as for the other user home
      directories.</td>

      passwd file and change the root home directory to /rootdir. The cp -r /.??* command copies all files and subdirectories of file names beginning with "." into the new root directory, which preserves the previous root environment. Ensure you are in

      relative paths, executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive
      colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. Entries starting with a slash (/) are absolute paths.

<td>To view the root user's PATH, log in as the root user, and execute: # env | grep PATH This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon, or two

        finding.</td>
<td>For each world-writable path in root's executable search path, do one of the following: 1. Remove the world-writable permission on the directory. Procedure: # chmod o-w &lt;path&gt; 2. Remove the world-writable

      files.</td>
<td>Confirm all accounts with a GID of 499 and below are used by a system account. Procedure: List all the users with a GID of 0-499. # cut -d: -f 1,4 /etc/passwd|egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$" If a GID reserved for system

      immediately lock out detected intrusion
      attempts.</td>

<td>Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software
      patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced system administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist,
      patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent recommended updates and security patches are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses present in the unpatched software. The lack
      of prompt attention to patching could result in a system
      compromise.</td>

        unowned due to communication issues.</td>
<td>All directories and files (executable and data) will have an identifiable owner and group name. Either trace files to an authorized user, change the file's owner to root, or delete them. Determine the legitimate

      For systems located on isolated or closed networks, it is not necessary to synchronize with a global authoritative time source. If a global authoritative time source is not available to systems on an isolated network, a local authoritative time
      source must be established on this network and used by the systems connected to this network. This is necessary to provide the ability to correlate events and allow for the correct operation of time-dependent protocols between systems on the
      isolated network. If the system is completely isolated (i.e., it has no connections to networks or other systems), time synchronization is not required as no correlation of events between systems will be necessary. If the system is completely

<td>The 'ldd' command must be disabled unless it protects against the execution of untrusted files.</td>
<td>The 'ldd' command provides a list of dependent libraries needed by a given binary, which is useful for troubleshooting software. Instead of parsing the binary file, some 'ldd' implementations invoke the program
      with a special environment variable set, which causes the system dynamic linker to display the list of libraries. Specially crafted binaries can specify an alternate dynamic linker which may cause a program to be executed instead of examined. If
      the program is from an untrusted source, such as in a user home directory, or a file suspected of involvement in a system compromise, unauthorized software may be executed with the rights of the user running 'ldd'. Some 'ldd' implementations
      include protections that prevent the execution of untrusted files. If such protections exist, this requirement is not applicable. An acceptable method of disabling 'ldd' is changing its mode to 0000. The SA may conduct troubleshooting by
