If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition

Setting the SELinux policy to <code>targeted</code> or a more specialized policy
ensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be
targeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.

Note: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to
temporarily place non-production systems in <code>permissive</code> mode. In such
temporary cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work
is completed, the system should be reconfigured to
<code><ns0:sub xmlns:ns0="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_selinux_policy_name"></ns0:sub></code>.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
