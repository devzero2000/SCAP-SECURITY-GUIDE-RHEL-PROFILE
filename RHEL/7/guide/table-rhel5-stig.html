<td>The root user's home directory must not be the root directory (/).</td>
<td>Changing the root home directory to something other than / and assigning it a 0700 protection makes it more difficult for intruders to manipulate the system by reading the files root places in its default directory. It also gives root the same discretionary access control for root's home directory as for the other user home directories.</td>

<td>The root home directory should be something other than / (such as /roothome).

Procedure:
# mkdir /rootdir
# chown root /rootdir
# chgrp root /rootdir
# chmod 700 /rootdir
# cp -r /.??* /rootdir/.

Then, edit the passwd file and change the root home directory to /rootdir. The cp -r /.??* command copies all files and subdirectories of file names beginning with "." into the new root directory, which preserves the previous root environment. Ensure you are in the "/" directory when executing the "cp" command.</td>

If this path includes the current working directory or other relative paths, executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands.  This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories.  If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory.  Entries starting with a slash (/) are absolute paths.

1. Remove the world-writable permission on the directory.

On single architecture systems, the "-F arch=&lt;ARCH&gt;" restriction may be omitted, but if present must match either the architecture of the system or its corresponding generic architecture. The architecture of the system may be determined by running "uname -m". See the auditctl(8) manpage for additional details.
Any restrictions (such as with "-F") beyond those provided in the example rules are not in strict compliance with this requirement, and are a finding unless justified and documented appropriately.
The use of audit keys consistent with the provided example is encouraged to provide for uniform audit logs, however omitting the audit key or using an alternate audit key is not a finding.

<td>The 'ldd' command must be disabled unless it protects against the execution of untrusted files.</td>
<td>The 'ldd' command provides a list of dependent libraries needed by a given binary, which is useful for troubleshooting software.  Instead of parsing the binary file, some 'ldd' implementations invoke the program with a special environment variable set, which causes the system dynamic linker to display the list of libraries.  Specially crafted binaries can specify an alternate dynamic linker which may cause a program to be executed instead of examined.  If the program is from an untrusted source, such as in a user home directory, or a file suspected of involvement in a system compromise, unauthorized software may be executed with the rights of the user running 'ldd'.  

Some 'ldd' implementations include protections that prevent the execution of untrusted files.  If such protections exist, this requirement is not applicable.

An acceptable method of disabling 'ldd' is changing its mode to 0000.  The SA may conduct troubleshooting by temporarily changing the mode to allow execution and running the 'ldd' command as an unprivileged user upon trusted system binaries.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Remove the execute permissions from the 'ldd' executable.
